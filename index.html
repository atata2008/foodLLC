                <p>About our delicious chicken. <br>
                    The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a
                    subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread
                    domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[1], up from more than 19
                    billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.
                    Humans keep
                    chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as
                    pets. <br>
                    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
                    the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC). <br>
                    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                    Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in
                    the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western
                    Asia
                    Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century
                    BC,
                    with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and
                    Shinar,
                    Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

                <p>About our awesome beef. <br> People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of
                    the
                    earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People
                    domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather. Cattle have been
                    domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history. The first domestication event
                    occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent,
                    around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indus Valley. There is a possible
                    third
                    domestication even 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species Bos africanus arising in Africa.
                    Most cattle originated in the Old World, with the exception of bison hybrids, which originated in
                    the Americas. Examples include the Wagyū from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from Egypt, and longhorn Zebu
                    from
                    the Indian subcontinent.<br>
                    It is unknown exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World
                    as draft animals (oxen), for milk, or specifically for human consumption. With the mechanization of
                    farming, some breeds were specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and
                    Charolais cattle, or to improve the texture of meat, giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and
                    Wagyū. Some
                    breeds have been selected for both meat and milk production, such as the Brown Swiss (Braunvieh).

                <h3 class="block__h3" id="Sushi-link">Sushi</h3>
                <p>About our amazing sushi.<br>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi ("salted
                    fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the
                    rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.
                    This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term
                    sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated (shi) terminal-form conjugation,
                    sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour"; the overall dish
                    has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as
                    funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture. Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"<br>
                    Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for
                    the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the
                    rice,
                    the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be
                    shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where
                    over
                    several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice
                    were
                    pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.</p>
